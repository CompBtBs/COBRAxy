Learn COBRAxy through hands-on tutorials covering different usage scenarios.

## Tutorial Overview

| Tutorial | Level | Duration | Description |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| [Galaxy Setup](galaxy-setup.md) | Beginner | 30 min | Set up Galaxy for web-based analysis |
| [Python API Usage](python-api.md) | Intermediate | 45 min | Programmatic analysis with Python |
| [Basic Workflow](workflow.md) | Beginner | 60 min | Complete analysis from data to results |
| [Data Formats](data-formats.md) | Beginner | 20 min | Prepare your data for analysis |

## Quick Start Paths

### I want to use the web interface
â†’ **[Galaxy Setup Tutorial](galaxy-setup.md)**

Set up a local Galaxy instance with COBRAxy tools for point-and-click analysis.

### I want to write Python scripts  
â†’ **[Python API Tutorial](python-api.md)**

Learn to call COBRAxy tools programmatically in your analysis pipelines.

### I want to understand the complete workflow
â†’ **[Basic Workflow Tutorial](workflow.md)**

Follow a complete analysis from raw data to publication-ready figures.

### I need help with data preparation
â†’ **[Data Formats Tutorial](data-formats.md)**

Learn about input requirements, formats, and data preprocessing.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorials, make sure you have:

- âœ… [COBRAxy installed](../installation.md)

- âœ… Familiarity with command line or Python (depending on tutorial)

## Tutorial Data

Download example datasets used in tutorials:

```bash
# Download tutorial data
wget https://github.com/CompBtBs/COBRAxy/releases/download/v1.0/tutorial_data.zip
unzip tutorial_data.zip
```

The tutorial data includes:
- Sample gene expression datasets
- Metabolite abundance data  
- Pre-configured Galaxy workflows
- Expected output files for verification

## Learning Path

We recommend following tutorials in this order:

1. **[Data Formats](data-formats.md)** - Understand input requirements
2. **[Basic Workflow](workflow.md)** - Learn the analysis pipeline
3. Choose your interface:
   - **[Galaxy Setup](galaxy-setup.md)** for web-based analysis
   - **[Python API](python-api.md)** for programmatic analysis
