# Official repository for the COBRAxy toolset
> COBRAxy (COBRApy in Galaxy) is a user-friendly tool that allows a user to user to characterize and to graphically compare simulated fluxomics coming from groups of samples with different transcriptional regulation of metabolism. 
It extends the MaREA 2 (Metabolic Reaction Enrichment Analysis) tool that enables users to compare groups in terms of RAS and RPS only. The tool is available as plug-in for the widely-used Galaxy platform for comparative genomics and bioinformatics analyses.
