"""
Parsing utilities for gene rules (GPRs).

This module provides:
- RuleErr: structured errors for malformed rules
- RuleOp: valid logical operators (AND/OR)
- OpList: nested list structure representing parsed rules with explicit operator
- RuleStack: helper stack to build nested OpLists during parsing
- parseRuleToNestedList: main entry to parse a rule string into an OpList
